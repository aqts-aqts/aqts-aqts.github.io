        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>Our Identity:</h3>
        <p>Seaquam Coding Club stands as a thriving community within the halls of Seaquam Secondary School in Delta, BC, Canada. 
            Our club is a gathering of passionate coders, dedicated learners, and forward-thinking innovators.</p>
        <h3>Meetings:</h3>
        <p>Meet us in Room 1429 alternating every Day 2 and Day 4 to discuss projects or events, help others, or recieve help from others! We will also occasionally be hosting events during the meetings!</p>
        <h3>Open Conversations on Discord:</h3>
        <p>Communication is pivotal, and we've established a Discord server. We believe that to learn together, we should help each other and learn from each other through doing so.
            This platform fosters dynamic discussions, facilitates problem-solving, and nurtures a sense of community among our members. 
            Connect with us <a href="https://discord.gg/8TeGeBm63w" style="display: inline;">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Join our Classroom:</h3>

        <h3>Participate in the Canadian Computing Competition:</h3>
        <p>In previous years, our club has done extremely well in the competition. In 2023, two of our students, achieved the honour roll award in the Junior Division of the competition. 
            All of our participants scored well above the top 25%, and we are looking to push the boundaries even further this year!</p>
